# credit-card-fraud-detection-

This project credit card fraud detection using machine learning. The proposed model has been extensively tested on different types of transactions. The results were promising, almost all the fraudulent transactions could be detected successfully. In this model, we detected the fraudulent transactions and recognized which illustrates the robustness of the proposed system. This proposed model took the trained dataset and performed classification on basis of them.
